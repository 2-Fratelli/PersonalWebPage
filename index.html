        <h2>Introducing myself</h2>
        <p class="text1">
            My name is Francesco, and I was born on December 21, 2010, at 10:30 a.m. I consider myself a curious and thoughtful person with a strong inclination towards science, especially calculations, data analysis, and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring, observing, and learning, both through play and study, and I value the close bonds I have with my family and my pet. Throughout my life, my interests have evolved: I was initially drawn to the idea of ​​becoming a pilot, and later to paleontology, motivated by my fascination with dinosaurs and the mysteries of the past, which ultimately solidified my desire to dedicate myself to science. Although I am aware of the limitations of fiction, I am inspired by the real possibilities offered by scientific advancements, nature documentaries, and the constant support of my parents, who guide me in a continuous process of learning and personal exploration, summarized in Jean-Paul Sartre's phrase: "I am not what I am, and I am what I am not."
